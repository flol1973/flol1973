## 🚀 Projects  
- 🧮 **Grid-Based Epidemic Modelling**  
  Developed a simulation framework for epidemic spread using grid-based approaches, exploring the effects of neighbourhood-based interactions on infection dynamics.  

- 🔄 **Bi-Disperse Collective Behaviour Modelling (FSM)**  
  Modelled collective dynamics in multi-agent systems using **Future State Maximisation (FSM)**, where agents consider both self- and neighbour-future accessibility. Captured group-level coordination and cooperative dynamics in bi-disperse agent populations.  

- 🚶 **Gait Model Simulation**  
  Converted MATLAB pedestrian flow/gait model into a custom Python environment, including interaction force dynamics.  

- ⚡ **Avishkar Hyperloop – Sense & Control Engineer**  
  - Designed TELCU PCB for real-time sensor data collection and communication.  
  - Implemented **MQTT protocol** for large-scale data transmission.  
  - Redesigned **GUI for Avishkar 7.0**, improving system responsiveness by 35%.  
  - Ranked **Top 5 globally** at *European Hyperloop Week 2024, ETH Zurich*.   

*(More projects on the way – I enjoy documenting as I learn!)*
